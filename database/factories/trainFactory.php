    user_id is hard coded to be user 1
    name uses faker name making it a random name
    cargo uses faker text giving it some random text
    image is hard coded with the image names and randomize between the three
    cost uses faker random float 2 which is meant to fill it with a random float with up to point two digits but it usally comes up with an out of cost bounds error that stops the seeding process but still fills in the prevously valid ones
    destination uses faker random digit not 2 which makes it a random single digit number (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9)
